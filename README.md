# HTML-Pokedex-Using-TypeScript
 Learning how to use TypeScript in HTML, took up challenge from FreeCodeCamp, check the Article [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-typescript-how-to-build-a-pokedex-app-using-html-css-and-typescript/).  
 Here is the [Original Repo](https://github.com/ibrahima92/pokedex-typescript), I have not used it at all. Only the Idea has been coded here, with Terrible CSS, since I don't know CSS ~~What a nerd~~

Here is a sample of the Site, I made. Looks terrible, I know. CSS can indeed do wonders to a webpage. The screenshot was taken. It renders 50 pokemons at once (on page Load), to prevent API Spam on PokeAPI, can load 50 more on each click of button till Pokemon ID: 850. On clicking the button while requesting, you get an Alert as well (tells you to wait). ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
